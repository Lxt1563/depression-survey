\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a Gait Quality Aware Network (GQAN) towards the interpretability of silhouette-based gait recognition.
%
It tries to assess the quality of each silhouette and each part for the recognition via two blocks: Frame Quality Block (FQBlock) and Part Quality Block (PQBlock).
%
Specifically, FQBlock works in a squeeze-and-excitation style to recalibrate the features for each silhouette and the scores for all channels are added as the frame quality indicator.
%
PQBlock predicts a score for each part to compute the weighted distance between probe and gallery.
%
And a Part Quality Loss is proposed which enables GQAN to be trained with only the sequence-level identity annotations.
%
Besides, GQAN achieves very competitive performance under all walking conditions on CASIA-B and OUMVLP.
