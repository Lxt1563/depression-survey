%\section{Depression Recognition}
\section{Auxiliary depression diagnosis method based on electrophysiological signals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Depression is a mental illness that accompanies severe mood swings and aberrant brain activity.
These aberrant behaviors can be found using EEG to monitor brain activity~\cite{hughes1999conventional}.
Further, depressive episodes may accompany nausea, vomiting, chest tightness, and sweating~\cite{faris2006evidence}.
%Depression as a psychiatric disorder is frequently accompanied by abnormal brain activity and major mood alternations.
%EEG, as a method of tracking brain function, can detect these abnormal activities~\cite{hughes1999conventional}.
%Further, depressive episodes may accompany nausea, vomiting, chest tightness, and sweating~\cite{faris2006evidence}.
These symptoms are associated with autonomic dysfunction,
while signals such as ECG, heart sounds and pulse can reflect these changes to some extent.
Specifically, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is used extensively as a standard tool for evaluating autonomic nervous functions.
Moreover, research indicates that electrodermal activity is more sensitive and produces more significant changes in response to stimuli than cardiac or cerebral activity in the case of external stimuli or changes in the mental activity of the organism~\cite{zygmunt2010methods}.
In summary, the electrophysiology of depressed patients differs from that of healthy individuals.





%The electrophysiology of depression includes EEG, ECG, electrodermal, gastric, ophthalmic, and body temperature, and they are usually recorded by metal electrodes placed on the body surface.

Electrophysiological signals are caused by changes in the membrane potential of individual cells, which are usually recorded by metal electrodes placed on the body surface~\cite{widmann2015digital}.
Due to the non-invasive detection and easy use of electrophysiological signals, auxiliary depression diagnosis with them has become a hot research topic and the most promising research direction.
Actually, related researches are shifting from early traditional methods based on hand-crafted features to implementing deep learning architectures.
%We just focus on classified tasks.
%The methodological flow is as follows (We just focus on classified tasks).
%\emph{(1) Traditional machine learning:} It begins with feature extraction, then feature selection to acquire more effective and representative aspects of depression, and then creating prediction or clustering models based on these features to perform the classification problem~\cite{halilaj2018machine}.
%\emph{(2) Deep Learning:} It sends the original signal to a deep network so that it may automatically learn high-level features.
%Since it can address the issues experienced with human-crafted features, such as high threshold, labor expense, and low feature utilization rate, deep learning is gradually gaining the upper hand in machine learning.


%
%%Electrophysiological signals, which mainly include EEG, ECG, EOG, galvanic skin response, and body temperature, have been used extensively to diagnose depression because of their non-invasive detection and ease of use\cite{bruder2017right}.
%The electrophysiology of depression includes electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electrodermal, gastric, ophthalmic, and body temperature.
%Among them, EEG \cite{liao2017major,bairy2017automated,acharya2018automated} is used most frequently, followed by ECG\cite{ding2019classifying}, and EOG\cite{kim2018automatic}.
%It is interesting to note that practically ECG are used to identify depression by extracting RR interval sequences and using heart rate variability (HRV).
%Furthermore, as other types of signals are used too infrequently, we focus on EEG, and HRV-based depression recognition.

Depression's electrophysiology covers EEG, ECG, electrodermal, gastric, EOG, and body temperature measurements. EEG is utilized the most commonly~\cite{liao2017major,bairy2017automated,acharya2018automated}, followed by ECG~\cite{ding2019classifying}. It is noteworthy that ECGs usually have a wide range of applications to diagnose depression by extracting RR interval sequences and measuring HRV. In addition, as other types of signals are employed infrequently, we concentrate on EEG and HRV-based auxiliary depression diagnosis.
Meanwhile, due to the limited amount of relevant regression tasks, we are just focusing on the classification job.


\subsection{EEG}

EEG is the most direct and objective representation of human neurological brain activity.
It closely relates to brain activity and emotional state, provides a timely representation of the body's emotional changes, and offers a high temporal resolution for examining brain dynamics.
Therefore, the EEG is one of the most promising signals for an auxiliary depression diagnosis.
Current research continues to rely mostly on conventional machine-learning methods.
In the meantime, some academics have experimented with a subset of machine learning known as deep learning algorithms, which has led to significant advances.


\subsubsection{EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis based on traditional machine learning}
%The main points of a traditional machine learning-based method can probably be summarized as feature extraction and classification.
%The feature extracted from the EEG signals can widely be divided into two categories: linear analysis and non-linear analysis,
%the linear analysis can be further classified into two sub-categories: time domain, frequency domain analysis.

Feature extraction and classification are the two key components of a traditional machine-learning approach.
The derived features from EEG signals can be broadly grouped into two categories: linear analysis and non-linear analysis, with linear analysis further subdivided into the time domain and frequency domain analysis.

\end{figure}

Typically, time domain analysis focuses on the measurement and analysis of the raw EEG signal waveform in order to calculate more intuitive or physiologically significant EEG properties.
In the study of EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis, the time domain features generally used include the mean, variance, kurtosis, and skewness of the signal.
These features vary with the EEG signal's sliding window and precisely depict their temporal evolution.
Additionally, time-domain analysis can measure the synchronization and similarity of signals between various channels.
%In general, time-domain features of EEG signals are very straightforward and intuitive characteristics with evident physical significance.
However, fundamental linear indicators may not be adequate for describing the dynamic activities of complex interactions, and it is challenging to obtain a complete picture of the EEG by examining it just in the temporal domain.
%However, due to its limitations, it is challenging to provide a thorough picture of EEG using only temporal domain analysis.

Frequency domain analysis refers to characterizing a non-stationary EEG signal based on its frequency components and calculating all essential properties at the frequency.
The most often employed frequency domain characteristic is the power spectral density, which is normalized to estimate the power of the time series at each frequency.
In addition, typical methods for characterizing EEG signals in the frequency domain include bispectral analysis and spectral estimation based on AR parameter models.
Although power spectral density may evaluate the information on the frequency variation of EEG signals, it cannot simultaneously capture the time-varying information at the frequency components of interest for EEG signals with significant unpredictability.

Nonlinear approaches can capture the chaotic behaviour and abrupt changes in EEG signals caused by brain-based physiological phenomena~\cite{rodriguez2015analysis}.
In EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis research, prominent nonlinear features include correlation dimension~\cite{akar2015nonlinear}, Lyapunov exponent~\cite{ortiz2021futility,kustubayeva2021lyapunov,chopra2022using}, entropy~\cite{zhao2019cardiorespiratory,cukic2018eeg,zhao2021frontal}, Higuchi's fractal dimension, relative wavelet energy, and detrended fluctuation analysis, among others.
Each nonlinear indicator reflects the peculiar qualities of EEG from a different perspective, revealing information that other methods may not detect.
For instance, the correlation dimension indicates the system's complexity, the greatest Lyapunov exponent reflects the rate of uncertainty expansion and is sensitive to the system's initial value, and the entropy quantifies the system's amount of order.
On this basis, the researchers concurred that combining numerous nonlinear approaches is superior to a single method.
To verify the conclusion mentioned above, Acharya et al.~\cite{acharya2015novel} present a novel method for automated auxiliary depression diagnosis based on nonlinear techniques: fractal dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, Hurst's exponent, higher order spectra, and recurrence quantification analysis.
The results suggest that it can objectively and successfully diagnose depression by carefully combining nonlinear features.

%For EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis studies, numerous non-linear parameters have been discovered, including the correlation dimension \cite{akar2015nonlinear}, the Lyapunov exponent\cite{ortiz2021futility,kustubayeva2021lyapunov,chopra2022using}, and entropy \cite{zhao2019cardiorespiratory,cukic2018eeg,zhao2021frontal}.
%The correlation dimension describes the system's complexity;
%the largest Lyapunov exponent reflects the pace of uncertainty growth and is sensitive to the system's beginning value; and the entropy depicts the level of order in the system.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%The main process of EEG depression identification using traditional machine learning is shown in Fig~\ref{eeg_traditional}.
%There are two key points to emphasize: feature extraction and classifiers.
%According to the characteristics of EEG signals, feature extraction can be roughly  further summarized into two categories: linear and non-linear.
%However, brain activity is inherently non-linear, and the EEG signal is non-stationary \cite{walleczek2006self,Scott2006encyclopedia,klonowski2006application}, which lead to limitations in the linear approach to assessing the dynamics of depressive EEG.
%In contrast, the non-linear approach demonstrates a relatively clear advantage.

%Although the indicators employed differ, the prevalent classifiers are typically the same: k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis, linear regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, random forests, and probabilistic neural networks.
%Further, Mahato et al.~\cite{mahato2019electroencephalogram} compares various EEG signal analysis techniques and recommends the most suitable technique based on the accuracy for detection of depression.
%The study reveals that, in general, high classification accuracy is achieved by SVM, LR and ANN and highest classification accuracy of 98.33\% is achieved by SVM. Highest accuracy is achieved by SVM because it is more robust and computationally more efficient due to maximal margin gap between separating hyper planes and kernel trick.

Even though the applied indicators vary, the most prevalent classifiers are often the same: k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), LR, SVM, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, RF, and probabilistic neural networks.
In addition, Mahato et al.~\cite{mahato2019electroencephalogram} examine numerous EEG signal analysis approaches and recommend the best accurate technique for the auxiliary depression diagnosis.
It is shown that, compared to other methods, SVM has the highest classification accuracy since it has the greatest distance between the separation hyperplane and the kernel trick, which gives it greater robustness and computational efficiency, resulting in excellent accuracy.
%It is demonstrated that SVM has the highest classification accuracy compared to other approaches. Due to the fact that SVM has the greatest distance between the separation hyperplane and the kernel trick, it is more robust and computationally efficient, resulting in the most excellent accuracy.


%Hosseinifard et al. \cite{hosseinifard2013classifying} used associative dimensional features as input to a linear regression classifier and obtained 90\% recognition accuracy.
%Ahmadlou et al.\cite{ahmadlou2012fractality} fed fractal dimensional features of depressed patients into an augmented probabilistic neural network and obtained an accuracy of 91.3\%.
%Cukic et al. \cite{cukic2018eeg} obtained an accuracy of 90.24\%-97.56\% by feeding Higuchi fractal dimension and sample entropy into seven classifiers.


%As stated above, researchers use different physiological signals and features in physiological signal-based depression identification, which leads to slightly different outcomes.
%However, the the common classifiers are all consistent, including SVM, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF).

\subsubsection{EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis based on deep learning}
%\subsection{Application of deep learning in depression recognition}
%Applications of deep learning in depression diagnosis with the assistance of physiological signals have increased in recent times.
%All adopted models can be categorized into three main groups, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Based models, Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) models, a hybrid neural network.
Deep learning has been used more and more in recent years to identify depression using EEG.
All adopted models in these studies can be categorized into three main groups, namely CNN models\cite{wan2020hybrideegnet}, LSTM models, and hybrid neural networks\cite{saeedi2021major,qayyum2020hybrid,thoduparambil2020eeg}. And their detailed flow is shown in Fig~\ref{eeg_cnn}.



In specific, %CNN could capture spatial properties of features and has the ability of parallel computing.
the CNN-based model can automatically and adaptively extract useful information directly from the input data instead of manually selecting features.
%Additionally, it has two significant groups of data input formats: time series and feature images.
Acharya et al.\cite{acharya2018automated} present the first application of the deep neural network concept and CNN for auxiliary depression diagnosis.
The model's inputs are the EEG signals from the left and right hemispheres of the brain, respectively.
Five convolutional layers are responsible for providing essential features obtained from the input EEG signals to train the algorithm, five pooling layers are accountable for reducing the feature map's size, and three fully-connected layers establish a connection between neurons of one layer with the next one. Finally, results produce by the last fully-connected layer are applied to a soft-max function to detect depressive cases.
Similarly, Li et al.~\cite{li2019eeg} analyze different aspects of EEG (spectral, spatial, and temporal information) for mild auxiliary depression diagnosis.
Results show that spectral information of EEG signals plays a significant role, whereas temporal information significantly improves diagnostic performance.
They utilize the pre-trained ConvNet architectures on an EEG-based mental load classification task and achieve an accuracy of 85.62\% for recognizing mild depression and normal controls.
%Kang et al. \cite{kang2020deep} introduced a novel methodology of feature extraction to detect depression, which was exploiting asymmetry feature of EEG signals and converting it into 2D images.
%The produced image used as input of a CNN model which had constructed from three two-dimensional
%convolution layers with the ReLU as activation function, three two-dimensional max-pooling layers, one flatten and one dropout layer, and two fully connected layers.


%As a model capable of remembering long-term dependent information, LSTM can read and modify the long-term dependent information of a temporal sequence arbitrarily when processing temporal signals like EEG.
The benefit of the LSTM when processing temporal signals such as EEG is that it can read and modify the long-term dependent information of a temporal sequence at will\cite{alhagry2017emotion,wang2018lstm}.
Only a tiny portion of LSTM research has focused on detecting depression through physiological signals.
Kumar et al. \cite{kumar2019prediction} research depression prediction by the LSTM model and the help of feature extraction.
Time-domain analysis with moving window segmentation generates input data to extract the statistical mean feature.
LSTM block comprises one LSTM layer with ten hidden neurons, a dropout layer of 0.1, and a dense layer.
They also compare the introduced method with two other models: CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM.
Among them, LSTM has the best performance over those structures since it owns the smallest RMSE values (Root mean square error) as the model evaluator rather than them.


The majority of the hybrid neural network are combined models of both CNN and LSTM blocks.
Additionally, it has two significant data input formats: time series and feature images.
Concretely, Thoduparambil et al.\cite{thoduparambil2020eeg} design a deep model in which an integration of CNN and LSTM to detect depression.
Three CNN layers and three MaxPooling1D layers form the first section of the model, which is exploited to extract features.
The second unit includes two LSTM layers whose duty is to generate the feature maps by discovering different patterns in EEG signals and then retain the sequence of these learning.
Similarly, Sharma et al. \cite{sharma2021dephnn} also propose a new hybrid neural network called DepHNN.
CNN and LSTM are two deep learning algorithms used to capture the temporal dependencies in the time-series EEG input signals and to process the sequence learning.
Besides, Saeedi et al.~\cite{saeedi2021major} use brain effective connectivity method to convert 1 Dimension (1D) EEG signal into a 2 Dimension (2D) image. Then, they develop a classifier using state-of-the-art deep learning methods (CNN-LSTM) as a novel approach for the automated recognition of depression patients from EEG signals.
Finally, their experiments show that the spatial and temporal characteristics of the EEG
signals are captured by 1DCNN-LSTM. Relying on the results, the deep learning model can also effectively analyze brain connectivity.

\subsection{ECG}

Physiological variation of the interval between consecutive heartbeats is known as HRV. HRV analysis is traditionally performed on ECG signals and has become a helpful tool in auxiliary depression diagnosis~\cite{heart1996standards}.
Studies have shown that people with psychiatric disorders such as depression have reduced HRV, as evidenced by reduced parasympathetic control and increased sympathetic activity~\cite{jandackova2016heart}.
In a recent study, there are two overall strategies for HRV-based auxiliary depression diagnosis: traditional methods with hand-crafted features and end-to-end deep learning methods.
%Current, most studies have used conventional machine learning methods combined with HRV to auxiliary depression diagnosis. Although these methods achieve favourable classification performance, they have many drawbacks.





\subsubsection{HRV auxiliary depression diagnosis based on traditional machine learning}

Traditional machine learning, a mainstream paradigm in HRV auxiliary depression diagnosis, tries to discover depression-related variables and expand the feature set to improve performance.
Precisely, the feature set consists of time-domain HRV features, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features.
%In the interim,traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, etc are employed to do the auxiliary diagnosis.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There is frequent use of HRV time domain characteristics when evaluating the linear activity state of the cardiovascular system.
These characteristics are computed from the R-R intervals (R-wave peak to R-wave peak in electrocardiograms, RRI), which reflect both vagal and sympathetic modulation of the heart sinus node~\cite{sgoifo2015autonomic}.
In HRV auxiliary depression diagnosis, the time domain features commonly used include:
The Standard deviation of RRIs (SDNN)~\cite{shaffer2017overview}, the root means square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), the standard deviation of the successive difference of RR intervals (SDSD), the percentage of intervals more significant than 50 ms (PNN50)~\cite{schneider2017validity}, and mean value of RR intervals (MEAN).
SDNN reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities~\cite{byun2019detection};
RMSSD, SDSD, and PNN50 are more sensitive to parasympathetic modulation.
Furthermore, MEAN is associated with HRV intention~\cite{colombo2015clinical}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%Various statistical methods are employed to objectively describe the variability of the cardiac cycle using HRV time domain analysis.
%Time-domain HRV characteristics can be determined directly from the R-peak to R-peak interval time series (RRI).
%Common time domain features are the mean and standard deviation of RRIs (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD).
%SDNN is the most intuitive metric of overall HRV size and is frequently used to quantify cardiovascular adaptations; it is considerably lower in depressed individuals compared to healthy participants. RMSSD indicates the fast-varying component of HRV and can be used as a measure of the parasympathetic modulation of heart rate; it is much lower in depressed individuals compared to normal persons.

%%Whereas the mean of RRIs measures the intensity of HRV \cite{colombo2015clinical}, the SDNN measures overall HRV and reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous system\cite{byun2019detection}, and the RMSSD and PNN50 are more sensitive to parasympathetic modulation.

%The frequency domain provides a measurement of vagal modulation of the RRI derived from the electrocardiogram.
%The RRI can be separated into three components depending on the frequency band: very low frequency (VLF, 0.003-0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) band \cite{kidwell2018heart}. According to previous studies, HF is primarily affected by parasympathetic activities while LF is influenced by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
%The ratio of LF to HF indicates that sympathetic activity predominates as compared to parasympathetic activity\cite{billman2013lf}.
%For the changes in HRV frequency domain parameters in depressed patients, there are more consistent results both nationally and internationally, with significantly lower LF in depressed patients and a significant positive correlation between depressed mood and LF/HF.

The frequency domain provides a measurement of vagal modulation of the RRI derived from the electrocardiogram.
Frequency domain characteristics indicate numerous spectral components, including very low frequency (VLF: 0.0033 C0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF: 0.04 C0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF: 0.15 C0.4 Hz)~\cite{kidwell2018heart}.
LF is modulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic activities;
HF is modulated by parasympathetic activities;
and VLF encompasses nearly all spectral power, although its effect is obscure.
The ratio of LF and HF is LH.
It evaluates the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems~\cite{billman2013lf}.



%
%Frequency domain features indicate various spectral components, namely, very low frequency
%(VLF) (0.003 C0.04 Hz), LF (0.04 C0.15 Hz), HF (0.15 C0.4 Hz). LF is modulated by sympathetic
%and parasympathetic activities; HF is modulated by parasympathetic activities; VLF comprises
%nearly the entire spectral power, but the effect is unclear (Colombo, et al., 2015; Thayer, et al.,
%2010). LH is ratio of LF and HF. It measures the balance between sympathetic and
%parasympathetic activities.


%The typical HRV markers mentioned above are frequently used to detect depression as well.
%Kemp~\cite{kemp2012depression} summarized the achievements of numerous researchers and discovered that depressive individuals had much lower SDNN and RMSDD values in the time domain, HF values in the frequency domain, and HF/LF values in the frequency domain than healthy controls.
%The differences in HRV between individuals with severe depression and healthy controls have been further investigated in numerous subsequent research.
%Additionally to these markers, it was discovered that compared to healthy participants, depressive patients exhibited considerably lower PNN50 in the temporal domain and greater LF in the frequency domain~\cite{shinba2014altered}.

%%As heart rate fluctuation is a complex behavior originating from nonlinear regulatory processes, adaptation of nonlinear dynamics and information theory for HRV analysis has been suggested.
%Although HRV has been analyzed traditionally using linear methods, such as time-domain and frequency-domain analyses, growing evidence has demonstrated that linear HRV measures may not correctly represent the complex dynamics of heartbeat regulation modulated by the ANS~\cite{goldberger2002fractal}and that linear HRV features show a relatively higher inter-subject variability than nonlinear HRV indices, suggesting the importance of nonlinear HRV analysis.
%Schulz et al.~\cite{schulz2010altered} have shown that nonlinear HRV indices allow more reliable discrimination of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from controls than linear HRV features, as the latter exhibit high inter-subject variability.
%In particular, the non-linear features used for EEG: fractal dimension, Lyapunov's index, entropy, etc., also apply to HRV.
%Greco et al. \cite{greco2018assessment} found that non-linear indicators such as fractal dimension, sample entropy and recursive graph analysis demonstrated significantly higher heart rate variability even in subclinical depression compared to healthy controls.
%Daniel et al. \cite{vigo2004relation}found that depressed patients over 60 years of age had significantly lower sample entropy values compared to healthy controls.



%As heart rate fluctuation is a complex behavior originating from nonlinear regulatory processes, adaptation of nonlinear dynamics and information theory for HRV analysis has been suggested.
%Commonly used metrics for complexity assessment of HRV sequences include: entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, fractal dimension, lagged Panglais plot, quantitative recurrence analysis and Lyapunov's index. non-linear metrics such as fractal dimension, sample entropy and recurrence plot analysis were found by Greco et al. to demonstrate that even subclinical depressive states have significantly higher HRV complexity than healthy controls. Daniel et al. found that patients with depression over 60 years of age had significantly lower sample entropy values compared to healthy controls.

Nonlinear dynamics and information theory have been recommended as a modification for HRV analysis because heart rate fluctuation is a complicated behaviour resulting from nonlinear regulatory systems~\cite{goldberger2002fractal}.
Entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, fractal dimension, lagged Panglais plot, quantitative recurrence analysis, and Lyapunov's index are extensively applied metrics for evaluating the complexity of HRV sequences.
Greco et al.~\cite{greco2018assessment}  discover that even subclinical depressed states have much more HRV complexity than healthy controls using nonlinear measures like fractal dimension, sample entropy, and recurrence plot analysis.
Likewise, Daniel et al.~\cite{vigo2004relation} found that compared to healthy controls, patients with depression above 60 had significantly lower sample entropy values.


In order to recognize depression using HRV, a variety of classifiers can be used.
Kang et al. \cite{kuang2017depression} use the bayesian network to recognize depressed patients from healthy people, and the recognition results demonstrate the significant association between depression and HRV.
Byun et al.~\cite{byun2019detection} demonstrate the HRV-based recognition using the SVM classifier. Monitoring the changes in linear and nonlinear HRV features for various autonomic nervous system states can facilitate the more objective identification of depression patients.


\subsubsection{HRV auxiliary depression diagnosis based on deep learning}
Different from conventional machine learning, the method based on deep learning can self-learn features from input signals without manual feature extraction and feature selection.
For HRV auxiliary depression diagnosis based on deep learning, scholars build a deep end-to-end architecture and then push raw signals into deep architecture to let the model learn high-level features.
Specifically, they can be subdivided into two categories depending on the model used: CNN and RNN.



CNN does not need to extract and select features manually. Moreover, CNN can directly take ECG segments as input as an effective classifier.
Concretely, for auxiliary depression diagnosis, Mohanraj et al.~\cite{mohanraj2022deep} propose a neural network called DesNN.
The DesNN model contains seven convolutional layers, five bunch standard layers, three pooling layers, and one fully convolutional layer.
The last completely associated layer utilizes softmax actuation work to the output predictions, while any remaining layers utilize cracked amended straight unit (LeakyReLU) enactment work.
Similarly, Zang et al.~\cite{zang2022end} propose an end-to-end CNN network containing two convolution layers, two max-pooling layers, and one fully-connected layer. The activation function of the convolutional layer is the rectified linear units. After each convolution layer, max-pooling is applied to the obtained feature maps. The Softmax function of the fully-connected layer outputs normal or depression.
The experimental results indicate that the end-to-end deep learning approach can identify depression from ECG signals and possess high recognition performance. It also shows that ECG is a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of depression.



RNN is a network based on sequence information, where
adjacent information is interdependent. Usually, this interdependence helps predict the future state.
The layers in an RNN are connected to allow for the recurrent process. LSTM is a form of RNN that can learn long-term relationships. Especially, Noor et al.~\cite{noor2021predicting} present an RNN with an LSTM autoencoder to predict the risk of depression based on HRV. The RNN learns the signals from the dataset and passes those signals to the LSTM autoencoder. There are two parts to the auto-encoder
architecture in common. The encoder compresses the input, the
decoder attempts to recreate it, and the recurrent auto-encoder
joins the encoder and decoder, capturing the regenerated ECG
signals. The training process is done based on those signals.
A threshold value is taken to predict normal and depressed risky heartbeat. The excellent experimental results demonstrate that RNNs are superior to CNNs for processing HRV signals because they are naturally memory-rich.





%This model is much simpler than the other existing models, and the prediction results are praiseworthy.

%This research used data from 37 depressed patients and 37 normal controls. Small samples limit the use of other deep neural network models.


%Some previous studies [11, 12, 38] focused on classifying patients with major depressive disorder and healthy people, thus ignoring the identification of mild and moderate patients.




\subsection{Performance Comparison}

We evaluate the auxiliary depression diagnosis method using the EEG and ECG, two commonly utilized electrophysiological markers.
We review the effectiveness of the approaches examined in Tabel~\ref{tab_eeg} to provide greater insight into the electrophysiological signal auxiliary depression diagnosis methods' performance.
The experimental classification accuracy data (\%) are taken directly from the related source articles to conduct a fair comparison.
It should be mentioned that we focus on comparing how different techniques perform on the same data set.
The following list of observations can be summed up:



(1) EEG auxiliary depression diagnosis has transitioned from the early traditional methods to the application of deep learning architectures. The performance comparisons based on traditional machine learning and deep learning are summarized in Table~\ref{tab_eeg}.
Firstly, single-channel EEG analysis in the traditional method, employing the combination of measures, can provide the accuracy for discrimination of depression not lower than reported in other studies where multichannel EEG signals were analysed~\cite{bachmann2018methods}.
Secondly, the nonlinear analysis of EEG can be a valuable method for discriminating between depressed patients and normal subjects.
According to~\cite{hosseinifard2013classifying}, the accuracy of three classifiers is
higher for all nonlinear features as the input compared to power band features.
The brain system is a best-characterized nonlinear dynamical process.
The brain's nonlinearity limits linear analysis's ability to provide a complete description of underlying dynamics.
Finally, in contrast, the novelty of the deep learning model is that it does not require the employment of feature extraction, selection, and reduction. The model can self-learn and pick distinctive features during training without a separate feature extraction or selection step.
Acharya et al.~\cite{acharya2018automated} present the first application of the deep neural network concept for the auxiliary depression diagnosis.
Even though the accuracy could be better than the previous one\cite{acharya2015novel}, deep learning technology development is anticipated to lead to discoveries.


(2)
Recent research has produced promising results utilizing various machine learning techniques using ECG/HRV signals to distinguish depressed patients.
Firstly, the highest accuracy achieved in~\cite{byun2019detection} is relatively low compared to those results.
However, some previous studies reported the results based on a small number of samples~\cite{roh2014wearable} or
needed a description of the prediction accuracy validation method~\cite{sun2016objective}. 
Predictive performance may be overstated by cross-validation. 
Secondly, the performance of all HRV deep learning algorithms is above 90\%, but because the
datasets are different, there is no way to compare them fairly and unbiasedly.
Here, for this application, we focus on discussing the properties of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods. 
Traditional studies have used HRV features to discriminate patients with depression, and HRV is
usually expressed from the RR interval collected from ECG data. 
The QRS wave algorithm will inevitably be utilized to locate R-peak. 
The R-peak positioned by different QRS wave algorithms also has biases. 
On the contrary, the deep learning method directly takes the ECG signal as input without
extracting the HRV sequence. 
In addition, formal studies used simple classifiers to train features manually extracted from
HRV sequences. 
The performance of this type of classifier mainly depends on the feature selection process, which is
laborious and time-consuming. The deep model can overcome the shortcomings of manual feature extraction and selection.
