Depression is a common mental illness that hassevere adverse effects on individual and society. Traditional methods of depression diagnosis require a high degree of cooperation between professional doctors and patients, and are easilyinfluenced by subjective factors. Therefore, it is essential to findan efficient and convenient diagnostic method for depression. Inrecent years, many auxiliary depression diagnosis studies haveexplored different data modalities and made promising progress.Considering the rapid evolution of this field, this paper aims toprovide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in auxiliarydepression diagnosis. 
More than 300 research contributions areincluded in this survey, covering many aspects of depression prediction method: evaluation metrics, detection frameworks, object feature representation, context modeling, and training strategies, etc. 
We finish the survey by identifying promising directions for future research.
