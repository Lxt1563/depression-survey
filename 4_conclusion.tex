%\section{Depression Recognition}
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


\subsection{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Depression is the fourth largest disease in the world, but the medical prevention and treatment of depression is still in a situation of low recognition rate in China. The recognition rate of hospitals above prefecture level cities is less than 20\%, and less than 10\% of patients receive relevant drug treatment; Moreover, at the same time, the incidence of depression (and suicides) has begun to show a trend of younger age (universities, and even primary and secondary school students). How to find an efficient and rapid diagnostic method becomes imminent. This paper summarizes the research and application of various modal data in the diagnosis of depression, and provides a reference for designing a more convenient and fast clinical auxiliary diagnosis method.

%%%%%%traditional machine learning
Preliminary, the traditional machine learning method was widely used in the task of auxiliary depression diagnosis because of its advantages such as simplicity, easy implementation and strong interpretability.
Common classification and regression methods, such as SVM, RF, and LR, have achieved good performance in solving the problem of depression diagnosis in small samples.
However, these traditional machine learning methods need to extract features manually, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and may extract features with high dimensions, resulting in over fitting of the model.
Therefore, most researchers use methods such as principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions of extracted features and select the most useful features for prediction.

%%%%%%deep learning
With the development of artificial intelligence, deep learning methods have gradually matured, which is a method in machine learning based on learning representations of data to achieve complex function approximation by learning a deep nonlinear network structure.
In the auxiliary depression diagnosis method based on deep learning, the preprocessed data is usually input directly into the model for feature extraction.
Since the depression data changes in both the temporal and spatial domains, researchers use convolutional kernels to extract the spatial information and also use RNN or 3D convolutional kernels to extract the temporal information, and then combine them for prediction.
This method does not need to manually extract features, and the network can independently learn the high-level semantic information, extract the most effective features, and avoid the impact of human subjective experience.
However, deep learning models require large amounts of data for training and cannot explain the decisions they make, so deep learning-based auxiliary depression diagnosis needs further exploration.

%%%%%%limitations
Great progress has been made in the diagnosis of depression based on each modality, but many studies still have certain limitations:
(1) They ignore the changes of patients in the temporal dimension and do not take into account the effects of medication and other factors on the patient's body.
(2) Most studies use scales to determine depression labels for diagnosed by professional physicians and lack reliability.
(3) Some behavior data are usually collected by machine, recording the communication between human and machine, rather than collected from human-to-human conversation, which may not match the responses in real scenarios.
(4) There is no more breakdown of depression categories.

\subsection{Future Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the future, in order to obtain more reliable prediction results of depression, researchers should try from many aspects.
(1) Researchers should consider collecting more data from more angles, enriching data types, and collecting data of diagnosed depression patients as much as possible.
(2) It can track the data of subjects for a long time to analyze the influence of drugs or other factors on patients with depression.
(3) Depression can be further subdivided to explore and analyze different types of depression.

Among the auxiliary depression diagnosis method, researchers need to gain insight into the pathogenesis of depression and look for the causes of abnormal manifestations in order to develop a more rational diagnostic model.
More over, researchers also need to consider the characteristics of the spatio-temporal dimension of the data and extract more effective features for prediction.

To be clear, these methods are not propose as standalone diagnostic tools that could replace current approaches to diagnosing depression, but instead proposed as part of a broader awareness, detection, and auxiliary system.
It is also hope that multimodal depression analysis can help more patients with depression get early intervention and treatment, and provide more effective help for the diagnosis of patients with depression.
