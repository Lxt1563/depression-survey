\section{Auxiliary depression diagnosis method based on Brain Imaging}
\label{sec_approach}

The structure and function of brain are abnormal in depressed patients.
To a certain extent, they inhibit the speed of thinking of patients, seriously causing cognitive damage, and even mental illness.
In addition, depression can atrophy the hippocampus of the patient's brain, change neurotransmitters, and cause chronic inflammation, leading to memory loss, slow thinking, and fatigue, which greatly reduces the energy level and motivation of the patient and makes it difficult for them to socialize.
These findings have found a new breakthrough point for auxiliary diagnosis of depression.

Brain imaging refers to techniques that employ an interaction between brain tissue and various forms of energy (e.g., electromagnetic or particle radiation), rather than physical incision, to capture positional data about the structure and function of the brain.
Brain images can be divided into Functional Nearinfrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Nuclear Magnetic Resolution Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and Postron Emission Computed Tomography (PET), etc. according to different imaging technologies.
As other types of images are used too infrequently, we mainly focus on fNIRS and MRI-based auxiliary diagnosis of depression.
These brain images have several advantages, such as safety, painless, non-invasive, which are important tools for depression diagnosis.


%As shown in Fig \ref{brain-imaging}, brain images are acquired by scanning the subject's brain with various precision instruments, and there are significant differences in brain volume and structure among different people, as well as a large amount of interference and noise in the acquisition data due to the slight head movement of the subject or the scanning equipment during the acquisition process, so image pre-processing is needed to eliminate individual differences and noise interference. Among them, image normalization includes head movement correction, brain tissue separation, and segmentation alignment, this step can remove individual differences and head movement interference. Image denoising is mainly used to remove the noise generated by the external environment and equipment, and the common methods include Gaussian filtering, band-pass filtering, wavelet transform, etc. In the feature extraction process, linear models, wavelet packet decomposition and other methods are usually applied to extract time and frequency domain features, or the features of each brain region are extracted according to standard brain templates, and then redundant and irrelevant features are removed using feature selection algorithms, and the effective features are fused for subsequent classification.

\subsection{fNIRS}
\label{sec_fquality}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
fNIRS uses the scattering of blood to near-infrared light to obtain the changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) during brain activity, which reflects the activities of neuronal and brain cognitive function, and is a useful tool to auxiliary diagnosis of depression
%fNIRS utilizes the scattering properties of blood to near-infrared light to obtain changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin during brain activity.
%It is an important tool for the study of brain function imaging. It can be used to compare the differences in brain function between healthy and mentally ill patients, and to achieve non-invasive detection of brain function.
~\cite{2018Reduced,2019Brain,2014Relationship,2016Correlation,2019The}.

\subsubsection{fNIRS auxiliary depression diagnosis based on traditional machine learning}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The research on fNIRS based auxiliary depression diagnosis is still mainly based on traditional machine learning algorithms~\cite{2019Machine}~\cite{2017Machine}.
Traditional machine learning classifiers rely heavily on manually extracted features, and different features can be divided into linear and nonlinear.
Linear features are usually used in fNIRS analysis, such as mean, peak, valley, average, variance and other feature indicators of the blood oxygen response function (HbO, HbR, HbT).
These are the features of task related cortical regions extracted by measuring the process of motor imagination task, visual task, cognitive task, etc., and recognized by machine learning classifiers such as SVM, OneR, RF, XGBoost~\cite{2015Automatic,2017Automatic,2020Classifying}.
%In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown great potential in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders including depression~\cite{2019Machine}~\cite{2017Machine}. 
%The most common machine learning algorithms for predictive classification such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) and naïve bayes,etc, have been applied to fNIRS data to classify Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients and healthy individuals. All of these methods have yielded good results in depression identification~\cite{2017Automatic}. 
%Hong et al.~\cite{2015Automatic} designed a SVM based classifier to classify the features extracted from fNIRS.
%There are also some integrated machine learning methods that have been applied in depression recognition, such as Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),etc. Zhu et al.~\cite{2020Classifying} extracted ten features from HbO signals, from each channel served as inputs to XGBoost and RF algorithms developed for each block and combination of successive blocks.

Secondly, some researchers applied the statistical parameter mapping method based on the General Linear Model to the task of auxiliary depression diagnosis. In this method, the linear combination of fNIRS data and regression quantity reflecting the design of stimulation scheme is fitted. Therefore, General Linear Model has higher statistical effectiveness than the average value, because it considers the whole fNIRS time series and takes advantage of the higher sampling rate recorded by fNIRS~\cite{2015Automatic2}.

%Fu recruited 43 patients with bipolar depression to assess changes in frontal region oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) levels during the TOL task and VFT using a 41-channel NIRS system. The results showed that the level of oxyhemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex was significantly lower in patients with bipolar depression~\cite{2018Reduced}.
%By studying the association between brain mitochondrial dysfunction and mood disorders, Holper~\cite{2019Brain} found that brain cytochrome cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was decreased in patients with depression, and was inversely proportional to the severity of depression.
%Liu confirmed that hypoactivation in prefrontal cortex of MDD patients with anxious and obsessive-compulsive symptoms~\cite{2014Relationship}.
%Kawano found that oxy-Hb in the frontal lobe was negatively correlated with depression detection scale scores on NIRS~\cite{2016Correlation}.
In addition, other researchers are committed to extracting features from fNIRS frequency domain signals, and using Fourier transform, wavelet transform and other methods to analyze the signal spectrum to extract effective recognition features~\cite {2015Automatic}.

\subsubsection{fNIRS auxiliary depression diagnosis based on deep learning}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Traditional machine learning classification methods require a priori feature preprocessing to train the model, extensive reliance on manual feature extraction and selection. 
%By using deep Learning methods like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), etc, records can be fed directly to the algorithm for training, avoiding the need for feature selection. As a result, more and more researchers have applied deep learning algorithms to multimodal fNIRS classification tasks~\cite{2022Deep},and have also achieved high accuracy in depression recognition and diagnosis~\cite{2021Depression}.
%Ma et al.\cite{2020DISTINGUISHING} was able to distinguish bipolar depression from major depressive disorder in adults during a verbal fluency task by using an LSTM~.
%Chao et al.~\cite{2021fNIRS} used a cascade forward neural network to classify depression and achieved excellent results.
The emergence of AlexNet confirmed the dominance of deep learning in computer vision, and also provided more possibilities for the application of deep learning methods in fNIRS auxiliary depression diagnosis~\cite{2022Deep}. 
This CNN method recognizes the original blood data, manually extracted HbO, HbR, HbT features and channel correlation as inputs~\cite{2021Depression}.

The RNN method makes the artificial neural network have a strong ability of time series signal classification and prediction, so it has a wide range of applications in the field of natural language processing. Because fNIRS data has significant time series characteristics, the method based on RNN is gradually applied to this field. Among them, LSTM is the most representative, which can solve the long-term dependence problem of general RNN, and can effectively analyze and predict the time series signals in fNIRS data~\cite{2021fNIRS}.

In addition, some researchers combine CNN and LSTM to increase the network's ability to extract hidden information from fNIRS data, making the model more comprehensive and stable~\cite{2020DISTINGUISHING }.

\subsection{MRI}
%\label{sec_fquality}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%MRI is a new examination technology based on the principle that atomic nuclei with magnetic distance can produce transitions between energy levels under the action of a magnetic field. It helps to check the energy state and cerebral blood flow of the patient's brain.
MRI is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces three dimensional detailed anatomical images. It is often used for disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring.
It is a examination technology based on the principle that atomic nuclei with magnetic distance can produce transitions between energy levels under the action of a magnetic field.
Physicians are able to tell the difference between various types of tissues based on these magnetic properties.
It helps to check the energy state and cerebral blood flow of the patient's brain. 
It can not only describe the changes in the volume or structure of brain tissue, but also reflect the changes in neural activity in the brain. It provides a great value in the auxiliary diagnosis of depression.
In MRI techniques, the MRI images obtained with different scanning parameters include structural MRI (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI).

%A meta-analysis of 29 studies fulfilling specific criteria was performed, Santos ecreased hippocampal volume found widespread in patients with major depressive disorder~\cite{Santos2018Global}.Narita found that the volume of the ventral prefrontal cortex decreased in patients with depression~\cite{2011Volume}.
%Taki examined structural differences in regional gray matter volume between depressed patients and non-depressed normal subjects by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based on  MRI, found bilateral medial frontal lobes in depressed patients and significantly smaller volume in the right central front~\cite{2005Male}.
%Zhang investigated the relationship between subthreshold depression (StD) and MDD, and found similar patterns of gray matter volume(GMV) reduction in the orbitofrontal cortex and left temporal gyrus~\cite{2020Subthreshold}.
%In addition, other studies have found that different levels of depression are associated with changes in habenula volume~\cite{2013Habenula}~\cite{J2013P}.

%\subsubsection{sMRI}
%\textbf{sMRI}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The sMRI images can clearly show the anatomical structure of the brain with high spatial resolution and can be used to objectively reflect the structural morphological changes within the brain~\cite{Santos2018Global,2011Volume,2013Habenula,J2013P,2013Evaluation,P2020Radiological,2019Depression}.
fMRI uses magnetic resonance imaging to measure changes in hemodynamics caused by neuronal activity. 
It can observe the changes of the brain through the small changes in the magnetic resonance signal caused by the oxygenation state of the brain, thereby revealing the relationship between brain activity and thinking.
And most of the researches based on MRI auxiliary diagnosis of depression are conducted using fMRI.

%The detection of depression from sMRI scans usually includes processes such as image acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classification. Machine learning methods have also been widely used, such as One Rule (OneR), SVM, Information Gain (IG) and ReliefF, etc~\cite{2013Evaluation}~\cite{P2020Radiological}.
%Deep learning methods have brought out remarkable results in medical imaging analysis, such as Mousavian et al.~\cite{2019Depression} found that the pre-trained VGG 16 and fine- tuning produced good results.

%\subsubsection{fMRI}
%\label{sec_fquality}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%fMRI uses magnetic resonance imaging to measure changes in hemodynamics caused by neuronal activity. It can observe the changes of the brain through the small changes in the magnetic resonance signal caused by the oxygenation state of the brain, thereby revealing the relationship between brain activity and thinking. According to different experimental conditions, fMRI is mainly divided into Resting State fMRI (RS-fMRI) and Task State fMRI (TS-fMRI).

According to different experimental conditions, fMRI is mainly divided into Resting State fMRI (RS-fMRI) and Task State fMRI (TS-fMRI).
TS-fMRI refers to the process of collecting data, subjects need to perform specific tasks, such as exercise, cognitive activities.
TS-fMRI is model driven and requires careful experiment design. The quality of the model is closely related to the experiment design.
The analysis based on TS-fMRI is model driven, usually using GLM to extract linear features, and then applying statistical tests for analysis.
In contrast, RS-fMRI is the fMRI image when the brain does not perform specific cognitive tasks, and keeps quiet, relaxed and awake~\cite{2018Disrupted}. 
RS-fMRI does not depend on the experimental design. It also has some physiological significance to detect the blood oxygen level dependent signal of subjects in resting state.
In addition, RS-fMRI images have the ability to reveal low-frequency blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations, which can be used to monitor the abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity caused by mental diseases.
Therefore, RS-fMRI is also more used to assist in the diagnosis of depression.

%RS-fMRI collects data when the subjects are in a relaxed state. Since there is no task interference, it can help doctors understand brain development, diseases, etc~\cite{2018Disrupted}. RS-fMRI is mainly aimed at the analysis of regional brain activity and functional connectivity of brain regions.
%Many researchers have built machine learning classification models to predict the accuracy of depression~\cite{2013Identifying,2019Intrinsic,2019Resting}.
%Zeng et al.~\cite{2014Unsupervised} built an unsupervised machine learning model for MDD.
%Bhaumik et al.~\cite{2016Multivariate} extracted the features of the left posterior cingulate cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and input it to the SVM classifier for depression recognition.
%Yan et al.~\cite{2020Quantitative} exploited the hidden information embedded in dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and developed an accurate and objective image-based diagnosis system for MDD.
%To improve the generalization ability of classifiers, multicenter studies~\cite{2020Generalizable} have been conducted and cover deep learning algorithms.
%Zhao et al.~\cite{2020Functional} established a generative adversarial network depression classification model based on functional brain network connections in a multicenter sample. Jun rt al.~\cite{2020Identifying} distinguished drug-naïve MDD patients from healthy controls using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). 


%Murrough utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and two separate emotion perception tasks to examine the neural effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder(TRD), found that TRD patients had reduced neural responses to frontal faces in the right caudate nucleus compared to healthy volunteers~\cite{2015Regulation}.
%Johnston described an instrumental loss-avoidance and win-gain reinforcement learning functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 40 patients with highly treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and never-depressed controls, found that the predictive diagnostic accuracy of patients with abnormal striatal activity was as high as 97\%, while the predictive diagnostic accuracy of abnormal hippocampal activity was 84\%~\cite{2015Failure}.
%Current research combining machine learning with TS fMRI is mainly related to emotional face stimulation, speech and music listening tasks, and this method enables individual-level analysis and reduces subjective misjudgments.
%Machine learning classifiers have achieved good results in related research, such as Gaussian Process Classifiers(GPC), RF, SVM, etc~\cite{2013What}~\cite{2015Toward}.
%Because deep learning has the advantages of reducing human intervention, deep analysis and feature extraction, selection and classification in the same optimal deep structure. Gui trained a Deep Learning Network (DLN) model with fMRI data of listening to positive and negative music~\cite{2019The1}.

\subsubsection{RS-fMRI auxiliary depression diagnosis based on traditional machine learning}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The RS-fMRI analysis is data-driven, and GLM is also used. However, more nonlinear features such as functional connectivity, degree centrality, regional homogeneity, and low-frequency fluctuation amplitude are used for analysis. These features can better describe the characteristics of different brain regions or voxel regions, and are important features for describing RS-fMRI images~\cite {lord2012changes，2013Identifying，2016Multivariate，wang2017depression}.

Secondly, multivariable pattern analysis is also widely used in the research of individual level diagnosis and classification of mental diseases. This method can judge whether an unknown type of subject sample has certain diseases by modeling multivariable data of a predetermined type. On this basis, researchers have also used multivariable pattern analysis to carry out the RS-fMRI based auxiliary diagnosis of depression~\cite {8575800}.

However, the common problem based on traditional machine learning methods is that the feature dimension is too high, and the variables of the input model greatly exceed the number of training samples, resulting in over fitting. Therefore, many researchers choose the least absolute shrink and selection operator to capture the key features, and further optimize them on this basis, using group least absolute shrink and selection operator, sparse group least absolute shrink and selection operator and standard least absolute shrink and selection operator for analysis~\cite{2015Toward}~\cite{ 2020Generalizable }.

\subsubsection{RS-fMRI auxiliary depression diagnosis based on deep learning}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Although the traditional machine learning methods still occupy the mainstream research position in the medical image field, the traditional methods need to manually extract features, which requires researchers to have some prior knowledge in related fields, and there is also the problem of removing redundant features, making the feature extraction process complex and burdensome. Deep learning technology provides more choices for medical image analysis by building neural networks from the main learning features.

Many researchers use CNN to process independent two-dimensional slices to learn effective features in RS-fMRI.
In addition, researchers also use 3D-CNN to capture 3D spatial information, or ST-CNN to extract spatial and temporal information at the same time~\cite {mousavian2020depression}.
Other researchers use graph-based approaches such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been leveraged recently to explore complex pairwise similarities in imaging/nonimaging features among subjects~\cite{2020Identifying}.
Finally, in order to understand the changes of the brain over a period of time, LSTM is also trained to capture the changes of RS-fMRI over time~\cite {mousavian2020depression}.
The lack of training samples is a serious problem in the application of deep learning methods in medical imaging. Therefore, some researchers use GAN to solve the problem of over fitting, but the effect is not ideal, and further research is needed~\cite {2020Functional}.

%\subsection{Others}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Brain metabolic imaging provides an accurate understanding of nerve cell activity and metabolic changes under normal conditions and disease states, as well as the metabolic situation of the cerebral cortex under different physiological conditions of stimulation and thinking activity. Brain metabolic imaging such as PET and MRS can visualize the metabolic activity and various physiological or pathological metabolic changes in human brain and reflect them in the form of images.

%PET uses the decay law or distribution characteristics of substances related to nuclear radiation, such as glucose, proteins, nucleic acids, etc., in the research object to obtain detailed information to reflect their metabolic activities to achieve the purpose of diagnosis.
%PET is mainly based on the annihilation effect of positrons and electrons and can be used to explore characteristic pathological states and indicators in depressed patients. By investigating the correlation between changes in metabolic function in MDD brain regions and depressive symptoms, it was found that compared to normal healthy subjects, depressed patients usually show such phenomena as decreased regional cerebral blood flow values and standardized glucose uptake values in the prefrontal lobe, increased total distribution of translocated proteins, and increased inflammatory markers~\cite{2017Functional,2017Elevated,li2018microglial,2014Cerebral}.

%MRS uses nuclear chemical shifts to study molecular structure and can be used to detect metabolite concentrations in brain regions.
%MRS can detect biochemical changes in the injured tissue of the body by magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy, which can effectively observe the metabolism of the injured area and has some clinical value for early diagnosis of the depression.
%It was found that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels were significantly lower in the left hippocampus, glutamine and glutamate (Glx) levels were significantly increased in the right hippocampus, and choline complex (Cho) and creatine (Cr) levels were significantly higher in depressed patients compared to controls, and correlated with the severity of depression in patients~\cite{2018Early,20181H,2013}.

%By examining the correlation between changes in cerebral blood perfusion and glucose metabolic function in the prefrontal lobe and depressive symptoms, Fu found that regional cerebral blood flow values and standardized glucose uptake values in the prefrontal lobe were reduced in depressed patients compared to normal healthy subjects~\cite{2017Functional}.
%Holmes believes that major depression is associated with elevated peripheral inflammatory markers. By comparing the utilization of transporters in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and insulation of patients with depression and healthy controls, the results found that transporter availability was significantly increased in glial cells of the anterior cingulate cortex during episodes in patients with MDD~\cite{2017Elevated}.
%Li explored the relationship between microglia-mediated processes and the pathophysiology of MDD by examining the distribution of  translocator protein total distribution volume $(TSPO \quad V_T)$, the results showed that the increased total distribution of translocated proteins was associated with decreased cognitive function in patients with MDD~\cite{li2018microglial}.

%N-acetyl aspartate(NAA) measures were interrogated through examining their relationship to previously documented ELS markers-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) corticotropin -releasing factor (CRF) concentrations, hippocampal volume, body mass and behavioral timidity. Coplan's study found that compared with the control group, the NAA level in the left hippocampus of depression patients was significantly reduced, and the Glutamine and Glutamate(Glx) level in the right hippocampus was significantly increased~\cite{2018Early}.

Brain imaging technology has revealed abnormalities in brain structure, brain function and brain metabolism in patients with depression, providing new ideas for early diagnosis and optimization of treatment plans.

\subsubsection{Performance Comparison}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table \ref{tab3} shows a summary of the experimental results based on brain imaging to detect depression.
As most researchers use their own collected data for the auxiliary diagnosis of depression based on brain images, the work among them is not comparable, but by comparing different methods of the same team, we can draw the following conclusions:

(1)Although the general linear model is the mainstream analysis method of fMRI images, based on its good ability to feature extraction, it has also achieved better results than the traditional linear feature extraction methods in fNIRS.

(2)When analyzing RS-MRI, the CNN based model has a stronger ability to identify the characteristics of depression than the functional connectivity network model.
Deep learning methods have applied to find spatial temporal relations among voxels of resting state networks. CNNs like network are known as best methods for finding spatial. 

(3)The lack of training samples is a serious problem when the deep learning method is applied to medical image analysis. Although the GAN model has not achieved good results, such a framework promises wide utility and great potential in neuroimaging biomarker identification.

%including the source and name of the method, the input brain imaging modality, the data set used (- represents that the data used were collected by ourselves), and the evaluation criteria of the experimental results, including Accuracy, FScore Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area Under Curve (AUC).

%SVM dominates the machine learning classifiers and usually achieves good results when compared with other classifiers. And deep learning algorithms usually achieve higher recognition accuracy than machine learning classifiers.
